1️⃣ Hero Section Enhancement (Global Physics Courses)
Current Issue

The hero section is text-only and feels flat.

Required Change

Add a full-width background image behind the “Global Physics Courses” heading, similar to the course detail hero image (Image 2 reference).

Image should be:

Academically relevant (campus, classroom, physics learning environment)

Slightly darkened using a soft overlay for text readability

Keep text center-aligned:

Main heading

Short description below

Maintain same typography, spacing, and color theme

No gradients, no harsh overlays

✅ Result:
Hero section should feel premium, global, and aspirational, like an international education platform.

2️⃣ Filter/Search Bar Styling (Minor Enhancement)

Keep existing layout (search + filters in one row)

Add:

Slight background container or soft shadow

More vertical spacing from hero

Filters should feel like a control panel, not floating elements

3️⃣ Course Cards – Image-Based Design
Current Issue

Icons/symbols feel generic and less engaging.

Required Change

Replace icons/symbols in course cards with course-specific images

Each card should include:

A top image section (rectangular, rounded corners)

Example:

JEE → classroom / problem-solving

NEET → medical + physics learning

A-Levels → international classroom

Below image:

Course title

Duration & mode

Short description

CTA button (View Details)

Image Guidelines

Use subtle, professional academic images

Images should be:

Consistent in size

Soft-toned

Not too bright or busy

4️⃣ Card Layout & Interaction

Increase internal padding for breathing space

Maintain rounded corners

Add subtle hover effect:

Slight lift

Soft shadow

Buttons should remain solid, not outlined, matching brand color

5️⃣ Visual Consistency Rules (IMPORTANT)

Follow same color palette as current site

No gradients

No visual clutter

Plenty of white space

Keep everything calm, academic, and premium

✅ Final Expected Outcome

Courses page feels:

International

Trustworthy

Parent-friendly

Student-focused

Hero section visually matches individual course pages

Course cards feel rich and informative

UI looks like a global physics academy, not just a coaching page
